The idea behind Datafun is to capture the essence of Datalog in a typed,
higher-order, functional setting.
%
Since the key restriction that makes Datalog tractable -- stratification --
requires tracking \emph{monotonicity,} we locate Datafun's semantics in the
category \Poset\ of partial orders and monotone maps.
%
Since \Poset\ is cartesian closed, it can interpret the simply typed
\fn-calculus, giving us a notation for writing monotone and higher-order
functions.
%
This lets us \emph{abstract} over Datalog rules, something not
possible in Datalog itself!
%
In this section we sketch the construction of Datafun hewing closely to this
semantic intuition.

Datafun begins as the simply-typed \fn-calculus with functions ($\fnof{\mvar x}
e$ and $e\<f$), sums ($\inj i e$ and $\ecase{e}{\dots}$), and products
($\etuple{e,f}$ and $\pi_i\<e$).
%
To represent relations, we add a type of finite sets $\tset{\eqt
  A}$,\footnote{To implement set types, their elements must support decidable
  equality. In our core calculus, we use a subgrammar of ``eqtypes'', and in our
  implementation (which compiles to Haskell) we use typeclass constraints to
  pick out such types.} introduced with set literals $\eset{e_0, \ldots e_n}$,
and eliminated using Moggi's monadic bind syntax, $\efor{x}{e_1}{e_2}$,
signifying the union over all $\dvar x \in e_1$ of $e_2$.
%
Since we are working in \Poset, each type comes with a partial order on it; sets
are ordered by inclusion, $x \le y : \tseteq{A} \iff x \subseteq y$.

As long as all primitives are monotone, every definable function is also
monotone. This is necessary for defining fixed points, but may seem too
restrictive. There are many useful non-monotone operations, such as equality
tests $\eeq e f$. For example, $\esetraw{} = \esetraw{}$ is true, but if the
first argument increases to $\esetraw{1}$ it becomes false, a \emph{decrease}
(as we'll see later, in Datafun, $\efalse < \etrue$).

How can we express non-monotone operations if all functions are monotone?
%
We square this circle by introducing the \emph{discreteness} type constructor,
$\iso A$.
%
The elements of $\iso A$ are the same as those of $A$, but the partial order on
$\iso A$ is discrete, $x \le y : \iso A \iff x = y$.
%
Monotonicity of a function $\iso A \to B$ is vacuous: $x = y$ implies $f(x) \le
f(y)$ by reflexivity!
%
In this way we represent ordinary, possibly non-monotone, functions $A \to B$ as
monotone functions $\iso A \to B$.

Semantically, $\iso$ is a monoidal comonad or necessity modality, and so we base
our syntax on \citet{jrml}'s syntax for the necessity fragment of constructive
S4 modal logic.
%
This involves distinguishing two kinds of variable: discrete variables are in lowercase ($x, y, \dvarlong{foo}, \dvarlong{bar}$), while monotone variables are capitals ($X, Y, Z$).
%
Discrete variables obey normal scoping rules, but monotone variables are hidden
within non-monotone expressions.
%
For example, in an equality test $\eeq e f$, the terms $e$ and $f$ cannot refer
to monotone variables bound outside the equality expression.
%
We highlight such expressions with a
\adjustbox{bgcolor=isobg}{\isobgname\ background}.
%
Putting this all together, we construct the type $\iso A$ with the non-monotone
introduction form $\ebox{e}$ and eliminate it by pattern-matching, $\eletbox x e
f$, giving access to a discrete variable $\dvar{x}$.

%% TODO: should we note that we really definitely mean □(L → L) and
%% not (□L → L)? Reader may be confused.

Finally, to express Datalog's recursive queries, Datafun includes bottom-up
recursion, $\efixis x e$, which finds the least fixed point of the function
$\fnof{\mvar x} e$. On this we impose two restrictions to ensure
well-definedness and termination.
%
First, the ``loop body'' $e$ must be monotone in the ``loop variable'' $\mvar
x$; i.e.\ the function whose fixed point we are finding is monotone. Second,
recursion can only occur at \emph{semilattice types with decidable equality and
  no infinite ascending chains}, $\fixtLkern$.
%
For our purposes, a semilattice is a partial order with a least element $\bot$ and a least upper bound operation $\vee$ (``join'').
%
Finite sets (with the empty set as least element, and union as join) are an example, as are tuples of semilattices.
%
As long as the semilattice has no infinite ascending chains $x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \cdots$, iteration from the bottom element is guaranteed to find the least fixed point; decidable equality ensures we can tell when this fixed point is reached.\footnotemark

\footnotetext{\label{note-finite-eqtypes}As a technical detail, the finite set
  type $\tseteq{A}$ will possess infinite ascending chains if $\eqt A$ has
  infinitely many inhabitants. Thus we need to distinguish a class of
  \emph{finite} eqtypes $\fint A$. Although their grammars in
  \cref{figure-syntax} are identical, their intent is different. For example, if
  we extended Datafun with integers, they would form an eqtype, but not a finite
  one.}

%% \item \todo{it might be better ignore this point for now and only discuss it
%%   when it becomes relevant.} The entire expression $\efixis x e$ is regarded as
%%   non-monotone, and cannot refer to externally-bound monotone variables besides
%%   the loop variable $x$. This may seem unnecessary, as the least-fixed-point
%%   operator is semantically monotone: $\fa{x} f(x) \le g(x)$ implies $f$'s least
%%   fixed point is less than or equal to $g$'s. The restriction is motivated by
%%   concerns that will not become clear until \cref{chapter-seminaive}, and we
%%   introduce it here so that we can discuss one consistent language throughout
%%   this thesis. It has the effect of preventing semantically nested fixed points;
%%   we discuss the kinds of programs this disallows in more detail in
%%   \cref{section-nested-fixed-points}. Note that this does not prevent mutual
%%   recursion, which can be expressed by taking a fixed point at product type, nor
%%   stratified fixed points \`a la Datalog.
