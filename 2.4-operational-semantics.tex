\section{Operational semantics}

\input{2-figure-operational-semantics}

We consider the denotational semantics to be primary in Datafun; as with
Datalog, any implementation technique is valid so long as it lines up with this
semantics.
%
To show such an implementation is possible, we present a simple call-by-value
structural operational semantics in \cref{figure-operational-semantics}\todo{ and show that all well-typed terms terminate}.
%
In our operational semantics we:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Drop the distinction between discrete and monotone variables, writing both
  in lowercase $x,y,z$, and cease using a \isobgname\ background for
  non-monotone expressions.
\item Assume all equality tests and all semilattice operations ($\bot$, $\vee$,
  $\kw{for}$, and $\prim{fix}$) are subscripted with their type.
\item Add $\prim{iter}$ expressions, which occur as intermediate forms in the
  evaluation of $\prim{fix}$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
We use a small-step operational semantics with evaluation contexts
$E$~\citep{felleisen-hieb-1992} to enforce a call-by-value evaluation order; an
evaluation context $E$ is an expression with a hole in it, written $\emptyhole$,
such that whatever is in the hole is next in line to be evaluated (if it is not
a value already). To fill the hole in an evaluation context $E$ with the
expression $e$, we write $\fillhole{E}{e}$.

We define a relation $e \stepsto e'$ for expressions $e$ whose outermost
structure is immediately reducible; we extend this relation to all
expressions with the rule:

\[
\infer{e\stepsto e'}{\fillhole E e \stepsto \fillhole E{e'}}
\]

\noindent
In our rules for $e \stepsto e'$ where $e$ is an \prim{iter} expression we make
use of a decidable ordering test on values, $v \le u : \eqt A$, and a
corresponding equality test $v = u : \eqt A$. We define these using
inference rules, but they are easily seen to be decidable by induction on $\eqt
A$.

%\subsection{Computing fixed points by iteration}

Our implementation strategy for $\efix f$ is
% \todo{suggested by the proof of \cref{lemma-fixed-point}:}
straightforward: starting from $\bot$, iteratively apply $f$ until quiescence.
%
We introduce the form $\eiter{f}{e_1}{e_2}$ to represent these intermediate
iterative steps. The intention is that $e_1,e_2$ shall be successive iterations
of $f$, with $e_2 = f\<e_1$.
%
The fixed point expression $\efix f$, after evaluating $f$, steps to
$\eiter{f}{\bot}{f\<e}$, which kicks off the first two iterations.
%
Once these have reduced to values, $\eiter f {u_1}{u_2}$ tests $u_1 = u_2$ to
determine if a fixed point has been reached. If so, its value $u_1$ is returned;
otherwise we step to $\eiter{f}{u_2}{f\<u_2}$ to evaluate the next iteration,
and so on.


\subsection{A logical relation for termination}

\todolater{extend this to handle adequacy}

\newcommand\evalsto{\stepsto^*}

\newcommand\oplr[3]{{#2} \prec {#3} : {#1}}
\newcommand\opequiv[3]{{#2} \equiv {#3} : {#1}}
\newcommand\oplrvalue[3]{\oplr{V(#1)}{#2}{#3}}
\newcommand\oplrvalueequiv[3]{\opequiv{V(#1)}{#2}{#3}}
\newcommand\oplrclosed[3]{\oplr{#1}{#2}{#3}}
\newcommand\oplrclosedequiv[3]{\opequiv{#1}{#2}{#3}}

To prove that all well-typed terms terminate according to our operational
semantics, we use a logical relations argument.
%
As a matter of notation, we will let $v,u,w$ range over values, $a,b,c$ range over closed terms and $\gamma,\sigma$ range over closing substitutions.

Our guiding intuition is that since we need an order structure in our
denotational semantics to prove the definedness of fixed points, we likewise
need an order structure on our syntax to prove the termination of fixed points.
%
To this end we interpret each type $A$ as a \emph{partial preorder}, $\oplr A x y$.
%
A partial preorder is a relation which is transitive and \emph{partially reflexive}, that is, $x \prec y \implies x \prec  x \wedge y \prec y$. While reflexivity may be glossed as ``every element is related to itself'', partial reflexivity glosses as ``if an element is related to anything, it is related to itself''; in other words, unlike reflexivity, it permits some elements to be ``outside the relation'' and unrelated to anything, even themselves.
%
Any partial preorder gives rise to a partial equivalence relation (PER), $x \equiv y \iff x \prec y \wedge y \prec x$, and a partial order over the equivalence classes of this PER; so our approach may also be considered to interpret types as partially-ordered PERs. \fixme{achim}{What is partially ordered and how?}

As a matter of fact we define a mutually inductive collection of partial preorders, on values $\oplrvalue A v u$ \fixme{achim}{Where was V(A) defined?}, on closed terms $\oplrclosed A a b$, on closing substitutions $\oplr \G \gamma \sigma$, on open terms $\oplr {\Gamma \vdash A} e f$, and on open terms paired with closing substitutions $\oplr{\Gamma,A}{\gamma_1,e_1}{\gamma_2,e_2}$. The rules for the value-relation are most complex, and we give them first:
%
\begin{mathpar}
  \infer{~}{\oplrvalue{\tunit}{\etuple{}}{\etuple{}}}

  \infer{
    \oplrvalue A {v_1}{u_1} \\ \oplrvalue B {v_2} {u_2}
  }{
    \oplrvalue{A \x B}{\etuple{v_1,v_2}}{\etuple{u_1,u_2}}
  }

  \infer{
    \oplrvalue{A_i} v u
  }{
    \oplrvalue{A_1 + A_2}{\inj i v}{\inj i u}
  }

  \infer{
    \oplr{(\hm x A \vdash B)} e f
  }{
    \oplrvalue{A \to B}{\efn x e}{\efn x f}
  }

  \infer{\oplrvalueequiv A v u}{\oplrvalue{\iso A}{\eboxraw{v}}{\eboxraw{u}}}

  \infer{
    \faex{i}{j} \oplrvalueequiv A {v_i}{u_j}
  }{
    \oplrvalue{\tseteq A}{\esetraw{v_i}_i}{\esetraw{u_i}_i}
  }
\end{mathpar}

\noindent
We define the other relations as follows:

\begin{align*}
  \oplrclosed{A} a b
  &\iff
  a \evalsto v \wedge b \evalsto u \wedge \oplrvalue A v u
  \\
  \oplr{\Gamma} \gamma \sigma
  &\iff
  (\fa{\hm x A \in \G} \oplrclosed A {\gamma_x}{\sigma_x})
  \wedge (\fa{\hd x A \in \G} \oplrclosedequiv A {\gamma_x}{\sigma_x})
  \\
  \oplr{\Gamma \vdash A}{e_1}{e_2}
  &\iff
  \fa{\oplr \Gamma {\gamma_1}{\gamma_2}}
  \oplr{\Gamma,A}{\gamma_1,e_1}{\gamma_2,e_2}
  \\
  \oplr{\Gamma,A}{\gamma_1,e_1}{\gamma_2,e_2}
  &\iff
  \fa{i = 1,2}
  \oplrclosed A {\gamma_i(e_1)}{\gamma_i(e_2)}
  \wedge \oplrclosed A {\gamma_1(e_i)}{\gamma_2(e_i)}
\end{align*}

\newcommand{\precright}{%
  \arrow[no line]{r}{\rotatebox[origin=c]{0}{\scalebox{1.4}{$\prec$}}}}
\newcommand{\precdown}{%
  \arrow[no line]{d}{\rotatebox[origin=c]{-90}{\scalebox{1.4}{$\prec$}}}}

\noindent
Note that $\oplr{\Gamma,A}{\gamma_1,e_1}{\gamma_2,e_2}$ may be seen as a transitive square:

\begin{center}
  \tikzset{
    no line/.style={draw=none,
      commutative diagrams/every label/.append style={/tikz/auto=false}}}
  {\begin{tikzcd}
      \gamma_1(e_1) \precright \precdown & \gamma_1(e_2) \precdown\\
      \gamma_2(e_1) \precright & \gamma_2(e_2)
    \end{tikzcd}}
\end{center}

\begin{theorem}[Fundamental theorem]
  If $\J e \Gamma A$ then $\oplr{\Gamma \vdash A} e e$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  By induction on $\J e \Gamma A$.
%
  The key case is the fixed point rule, whose proof is a syntactic version of
  the proof of definedness of fixed points in the denotational semantics. We
  therefore give this case here, and leave the other cases to the appendix: \fixme{jeremy,achim}{give the proof!}
\end{proof}

\noindent
It follows as immediate corollary (using the definition of $\oplrclosed A a b$)
that every closed, well-typed program terminates: \fixme{achim}{actually explain how this follows, it is non-obvious. Where does the ACC come into the argument?}
