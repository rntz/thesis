\input{2-figure-operational-semantics}

We consider the denotational semantics to be primary in Datafun; as with
Datalog, any implementation technique is valid so long as it lines up with these
semantics.
%
To show such an implementation is possible, we present a simple call-by-value
structural operational semantics in \cref{figure-operational-semantics} and show
that all well-typed terms terminate.
%
In our operational semantics we:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume all semilattice operations ($\bot$, $\vee$, $\kw{for}$, and
  $\kw{fix}$) are subscripted with their type.
\item Drop the distinction between discrete and monotone variables, writing both
  in lowercase $x,y,z$.
\item Add $\prim{iter}$ expressions, which occur as intermediate forms in the
  evaluation of $\kw{fix}$.
%\item Classify some expressions $e$ as values $v$.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
We use a small-step operational semantics with evaluation contexts $E$ after
the style of \cref{felleisen-hieb-1992} to enforce a call-by-value evaluation
order; an evaluation context $E$ is an expression with a hole in it (written
$\emptyhole$) such that whatever is in the hole is next in line to be evaluated
(if it is not a value already). To fill the hole $\emptyhole$ in an evaluation
context $E$ with the expression $e$, we write $E[e]$.

\newcommand\stepsto\mapsto

We define a relation $e \stepsto e'$ for expressions $e$ whose outermost
structure is immediately reducible; we extend this relation to all
expressions with the rule:

\[
\infer{E[e]\stepsto E[e']}{e\stepsto e'}
\]

\noindent
In our rules for $e \stepsto e'$ where $e$ is an \prim{iter} expression we make
use of a decidable ordering test on values, $v \le u : \eqt A$, and a
corresponding equality test $v \equiv u : \eqt A$. We define these using
inference rules, but they are easily seen to be decidable by induction on $\eqt
A$. The quantifiers in the premise of the rule $\subseteq$ range over finite
domains, and thus pose no issue.
